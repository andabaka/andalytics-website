**Are you still manually downloading geographic data for your forestry projects?**

I used to spend days collecting geographic data for forest research projects. The process was time-consuming: navigating multiple websites, dealing with inconsistent file formats, wrestling with different coordinate systems, and endless preprocessing.

It always felt like I was spending more time on data collection than on actual science.

But what if I told you that you could:

* Download complete geographic datasets for any forest region in seconds ‚è±Ô∏è
* Access elevation, soil, climate, land cover, and species occurrence data using one consistent interface üå≤
* Transform days of manual work into a 5-minute automated process ‚úÖ
* Generate publication-ready visualizations with minimal code üìä

In this tutorial, I'll show you exactly how the geodata R package gives researchers immediate access to important geographic datasets. You'll see examples with complete code that you can adapt for your own projects.

<br>
<br>

## Why Geographic Data Collection Frustrates Forest Researchers

Here's the typical researcher workflow:

- Manual website browsing - Navigate through multiple specialized data portals
- Format inconsistencies - Deal with different file formats, projections, and resolutions
- Data preprocessing - Hours of cleaning and merging datasets
- Quality control nightmares - Checking for missing values, outliers, and errors

But here's what changes everything: The geodata package provides instant access to high-quality geographic datasets with just a few lines of R code.

<br>

## The geodata Package: A Complete Geographic Data Solution

The geodata package is a powerful R tool that provides direct access to a wide range of geographic datasets:

1. **Climate data** - Current and future climate variables üå°Ô∏è
2. **Elevation data** - Global terrain metrics üèîÔ∏è
3. **Soil properties** - Soil characteristics at different depths üå±
4. **Land cover** - Forest cover and vegetation types üåç
5. **Administrative boundaries** - Country and regional borders üó∫Ô∏è
6. **Species occurrence data** - Tree and plant distribution records üå≥

Let's start by installing and loading the required packages:


``` r
# Install packages if needed
# install.packages(c("geodata", "terra", "tidyverse", "viridis", "sf"))

# Import packages
library(geodata)    # Geographic data access
library(terra)      # Spatial data manipulation
library(tidyverse)  # Data wrangling and visualization
library(viridis)    # Color palettes
library(sf)         # Simple features for spatial data

# Create directories for downloaded data and exports
data_dir <- "data"
dir.create(data_dir, showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "climate"), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "elevation"), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "soil"), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "landcover"), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "boundaries"), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "species"), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(data_dir, "exports"), showWarnings = FALSE)

# Define a forest-themed color palette
forest_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("#FFF7BC", "#D9F0A3", "#78C679", "#31A354", "#006837"))

# Check package versions
packageVersion("geodata")  # Should be 0.6-2 or newer
packageVersion("terra")    # Should be 1.7+ for best performance
```

<br>

## Tutorial: Accessing Key Forest-Relevant Datasets

Let's explore the various geographic datasets available through geodata that are particularly valuable for forestry research.

### 1. Elevation Data

Terrain characteristics significantly influence forest growth, species distribution, and management practices:


``` r
# Download Croatia boundaries first (we'll use these throughout)
croatia <- gadm(country="HRV", level=0, path="data/boundaries/")

# Download elevation data for Croatia
croatia_elevation <- elevation_30s(
  country = "Croatia", 
  path = "data/elevation/"
)

# Ensure it's properly masked to Croatia's boundaries
croatia_elevation <- mask(croatia_elevation, croatia)

plot(croatia_elevation, main = "Elevation in Croatia (m)",
     col = forest_palette(100))

```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/elevation.png" alt="Elevation in Croatia (m)" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>Figure 1: Elevation in Croatia (m)</p>
</div>

<br>

### 2. Soil Properties

Soil characteristics are crucial for understanding forest productivity and species distribution:


``` r
# Download global soil pH data (0-5cm depth)
soil_ph <- soil_world(
  var = "phh2o",  # pH in H2O
  depth = 5,      # 0-5cm depth
  path = "data/soil/"
)

# Proper cropping and masking to Croatia
croatia_soil_ph <- crop(soil_ph, ext(croatia))
croatia_soil_ph <- mask(croatia_soil_ph, croatia)

plot(croatia_soil_ph, main = "Soil pH (0-5cm depth)", 
     col = forest_palette(100))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/croatia_soil_ph.png" alt="Soil pH (0-5cm depth)" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>Figure 2: Soil pH (0-5cm depth)</p>
</div>

Other valuable soil variables include:
- "clay" - Clay content (%)
- "silt" - Silt content (%)
- "sand" - Sand content (%)
- "soc" - Soil organic carbon (g/kg)
- "bdod" - Bulk density (kg/m¬≥)

And multiple depth options (5, 15, 30, 60, 100, 200).


The geodata package provides access to global Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) data through its soil_world() function, which retrieves standardized measurements from the SoilGrids database. SOC values, expressed in g/kg, represent carbon stored in soil organic matter at various depths, with the topsoil (0-5cm) typically showing the highest concentrations. 

Let's also look at SOC, an important indicator of soil fertility:


``` r
# Download and process soil organic carbon (SOC) data
soil_soc <- soil_world(
  var = "soc",      # Soil Organic Carbon
  depth = 5,        # 0-5cm depth
  path = "data/soil/"
)

# Proper cropping and masking to Croatia
croatia_soil_soc <- crop(soil_soc, ext(croatia))
croatia_soil_soc <- mask(croatia_soil_soc, croatia)

plot(croatia_soil_soc, 
     main = "Soil Organic Carbon (0-5cm depth, g/kg)", 
     col = forest_palette(100))

```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/croatia_soil_soc.png" alt="Soil Organic Carbon (0-5cm depth, g/kg)" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-3"></span>Figure 3: Soil Organic Carbon (0-5cm depth, g/kg)</p>
</div>

<br>

### 3. Land Cover Data

Forest cover and land use are essential for forestry research:


``` r
# Download tree cover data
tree_cover <- landcover(
  var = "trees",  # Tree cover percentage
  year = 2020,    
  path = "data/landcover/"
)

# Proper cropping and masking to Croatia
croatia_trees <- crop(tree_cover, ext(croatia))
croatia_trees <- mask(croatia_trees, croatia)

# Convert to percentages for better visualization (data comes as 0-1)
croatia_trees_pct <- croatia_trees * 100

plot(croatia_trees_pct, main = "Tree Cover % (2020)",
     col = forest_palette(100),
     breaks = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100),
     lab.breaks = c("0%", "20%", "40%", "60%", "80%", "100%"))

```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/croatia_trees.png" alt="Tree Cover % (2020)" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-4"></span>Figure 4: Tree Cover % (2020)</p>
</div>

Other landcover variables include:
- "crops" - Cropland percentage
- "urban" - Urban/built-up percentage
- "grass" - Grassland percentage
- "shrub" - Shrubland percentage
- "wetland" - Wetland percentage
- "water" - Water percentage

<br>

### 4. Bioclimatic Variables

The 19 bioclimatic variables represent climate factors particularly relevant to biological species:


``` r
# Download bioclimatic variables for Croatia
croatia_bioclim <- worldclim_country(
  country = "Croatia",
  var = "bio",
  res = 30,  # 30 arc-seconds (~1km resolution)
  path = "data/climate/"
)

# Ensure proper masking to Croatia boundaries
croatia_bioclim <- mask(croatia_bioclim, croatia)

# Examine the data structure
croatia_bioclim

```

These bioclimatic variables represent annual trends, seasonality, and extreme conditions - all key factors in understanding forest ecology and species distributions. For the complete description of all 19 bioclimatic variables, see the [WorldClim documentation](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html).

Let's focus on a few key variables:


``` r
# Extract forest-relevant variables
forest_vars <- c(
  "wc2.1_30s_bio_1",   # Annual Mean Temperature
  "wc2.1_30s_bio_12"   # Annual Precipitation
)

croatia_forest_climate <- croatia_bioclim[[forest_vars]]

# Rename for clarity
names(croatia_forest_climate) <- c(
  "Annual_Temp", 
  "Annual_Precip"
)

plot(croatia_forest_climate, 
     col = forest_palette(100))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/croatia_temp.png" alt="Annual Mean Temperature in Croatia" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-5"></span>Figure 5: Annual Mean Temperature in Croatia</p>
</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/croatia_precip.png" alt="Annual Precipitation in Croatia (mm)" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-6"></span>Figure 6: Annual Precipitation in Croatia (mm)</p>
</div>

<br>

### 5. Species Occurrence Data

For biodiversity and species distribution studies, geodata provides direct access to GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) data:


``` r
# Check the number of records first (without downloading)
sp_occurrence("Quercus", "robur", download=FALSE)
# Output will show how many records exist (often > 1,000,000 for common species)

# Use geographic extent parameter to limit the search area
oak_region <- sp_occurrence(
  genus = "Quercus",
  species = "robur",
  ext = c(13, 20, 42, 47),  
  geo = TRUE,
  removeZeros = TRUE,
  path = "data/species/"
)

# Create spatial points from species occurrences
oak_points <- vect(oak_region[, c("lon", "lat")], 
                   crs=crs(croatia))

# Crop to Croatia borders
oak_croatia <- oak_region[terra::relate(oak_points, croatia, "intersects"), ]

# Create a map of the occurrence points
plot(croatia, col="lightyellow", main="Quercus robur occurrences in Croatia")
points(oak_croatia$lon, oak_croatia$lat, col="darkgreen", pch=19, cex=0.8)

```

**Important tip:** When working with species occurrence data, always check the count first with download=FALSE to avoid errors with very common species. GBIF has a 100,000 record limit per request.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/oak_occurrences.png" alt="Quercus robur occurrences in Croatia" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-7"></span>Figure 7: Quercus robur occurrences in Croatia</p>
</div>

The species occurrence functionality allows you to:
- Download data for specific species or entire genera
- Filter records with geographic coordinates
- Limit searches by geographic extent
- Crop results to specific country boundaries
- Access metadata like collection date and basis of record

<br>

### 6. Administrative Boundaries

Administrative boundaries are useful for forest management and planning:


``` r
# Download country boundaries at administrative level 1 (regions/provinces)
croatia_regions <- gadm(
  country = "HRV",  # ISO3 code for Croatia
  level = 1,        # Level 1 = regions/provinces
  path = "data/boundaries/"
)

plot(croatia_regions, main = "Administrative Regions of Croatia", col = forest_palette(100))

```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/croatia_regions.png" alt="Administrative Regions of Croatia" width="60%" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-8"></span>Figure 8: Administrative Regions of Croatia</p>
</div>

<br>

## BONUS: Forest Site Characterization in Croatia

Now let's combine multiple datasets to create a comprehensive geographic profile for a specific forest site:


``` r
# Define a forest location of interest
forest_loc <- c(16.2, 45.5)  

# Let's create extract function to extract values from rasters
extract_point_data <- function(raster, location) {
   
     point <- terra::vect(matrix(location, ncol=2), type="points", 
                         crs=terra::crs(raster))
    
    result <- terra::extract(raster, point)
    
    if(length(result) > 0 && nrow(result) > 0) {
        return(as.numeric(result[1, -1])) 
    }
    
    return(NA)
}

# Extract data for site using the datasets we've already downloaded
# 1. Elevation 
site_elevation <- extract_point_data(croatia_elevation, forest_loc)

# 2. Soil properties 
site_soil_ph <- extract_point_data(soil_ph, forest_loc)
site_soil_soc <- extract_point_data(soil_soc, forest_loc)

# 3. Tree cover 
site_tree_cover <- extract_point_data(tree_cover, forest_loc)

# 4. Bioclimatic variables 
bio1 <- extract_point_data(croatia_bioclim[[1]], forest_loc) 
bio12 <- extract_point_data(croatia_bioclim[[12]], forest_loc)    

# Create a summary tibble
site_profile <- tibble(
    Site_Name = "Forest Stand 1",
    Longitude = forest_loc[1],
    Latitude = forest_loc[2],
    Elevation_m = site_elevation,
    Soil_pH = site_soil_ph,
    Soil_Organic_Carbon_g_kg = site_soil_soc,
    Tree_Cover_Pct = site_tree_cover * 100, # Convert to percent
    Annual_Mean_Temp_C = bio1,
    Annual_Precipitation_mm = bio12
)

# Display the site profile
site_profile
```



```
#> # A tibble: 9 √ó 2
#>   Variable                     Value         
#>   <chr>                        <chr>         
#> 1 Site Name                    Forest Stand 1
#> 2 Longitude (¬∞E)               16.2          
#> 3 Latitude (¬∞N)                45.5          
#> 4 Elevation (m)                97            
#> 5 Soil pH                      5.9           
#> 6 Soil Organic Carbon (g/kg)   47.7          
#> 7 Tree Cover (%)               61.0          
#> 8 Annual Mean Temperature (¬∞C) 11.0          
#> 9 Annual Precipitation (mm)    925
```

<br>

This forest stand represents a typical continental woodland in Croatia's lowland Pannonian region (97m elevation). With moderately acidic soil (pH 5.90) optimal for oak species, high organic carbon content (47.7 g/kg), and substantial tree cover (61%), it represents a well-established, productive forest ecosystem with effective nutrient cycling. The climate conditions (10.98¬∞C annual temperature, 925mm precipitation) are characteristic of the sub-Pannonian zone, creating ideal conditions for deciduous forest communities. These parameters indicate a healthy, managed forest system that balances ecological functions with sustainable forestry practices.

## Exporting Data for Further Analysis

Once you've accessed and processed your geographic data, you may want to export it for use in other software or to share with colleagues:


``` r
# Export raster data to GeoTIFF for use in GIS software
writeRaster(croatia_elevation, "data/exports/croatia_elevation.tif", overwrite=TRUE)
writeRaster(croatia_soil_ph, "data/exports/croatia_soil_ph.tif", overwrite=TRUE)
writeRaster(croatia_trees, "data/exports/croatia_tree_cover.tif", overwrite=TRUE)

# Export vector data (administrative boundaries) to shapefile
writeVector(croatia, "data/exports/croatia_borders.shp", overwrite=TRUE)
writeVector(croatia_regions, "data/exports/croatia_regions.shp", overwrite=TRUE)

# Export point data (species occurrences) to CSV
write.csv(oak_croatia, "data/exports/oak_occurrences.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# Export site profiles to CSV
write.csv(site_profile, "data/exports/forest_site_profile.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# Additionally, you can export maps as image files
png("data/exports/croatia_elevation_map.png", width=2000, height=1500, res=300)
plot(croatia_elevation, main = "Elevation in Croatia (m)",
     col = forest_palette(100))
dev.off()
```

This makes it easy to:
1. Use the data in GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS
2. Share with colleagues who might not use R
3. Include in reports or presentations
4. Perform further analysis in other environments


<br>
